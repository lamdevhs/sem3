#   type Either e a = Left e | Right a
# /
# Two types of values which can have type `Either e a`:
# /
#   Left(x) : Either e a
#   Right(y) : Either e a
# /
# With `x : e` and `y : a` of course
# By convention, (and as a pun over `Right`) although `Either` symmetrical
# with relation to the types `e` and `a`, we generally use `e`
# for the types of messages of error (nearly always, `e = String`)
# and `a` for the types of values when there's no error.
# `Left(x)` thus represents an error and `x` is a report of that error,
# `Right(y)` represents a successful result with `y` as its actual content.
#
# algebraically speaking, the type `Either e a` represents the union of the 
# types `e` and `a`.
#
# Example of trivial function which could be written with `Either`,
# here with `e = String` and `a = List t` :
# /
#   # head : List t -> Either String (List t)
#   def head(list):
#       if list == []:
#           return Left("can't get the head of an empty list")
#       else:
#           return Right(list[0])
# /

    # result's content.
