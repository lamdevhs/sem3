TheCortexionist architecture has been presented as a simplified yet realistic model of the human memory. 
Firstly, procedural and semantic memory are represented, as well as their respective ways of learning.
Then, and above all, this architecture differs from previous attempts to model the human memory by not following the traditional multi-store design, to the benefit of a more functional approach.
Indeed, although the multi-store models are still very popular when designing computational models -for the convenient compatibility between the STM/LTM structure and the way information is processed by a computer- Craik and Lockhart argued the lack of neuro-scientific foundations of this theory, making any discussion about the storage of information in the brain futile.
In their "levels of processing" theory, they rather investigate the way stimuli are processed by the brain.
Through experimentations, they find out that a collection of random letters is quickly forgotten whereas it can last a whole week if they form a word.
Their conclusion is that the more processing a memory item involves, the longer it is likely to be held in memory. Furthermore, the stimulus seems to acquire more semantic meaning according to the time granted to this processing.
These results have led Craik and Lockhart to represent human memory as a multi-layered structure, where the deepest layers might present the greatest complexity or abstraction and the best durability.
We believe that taking this theory into account constitutes the next step towards making Cortexionist a more realistic model of human memory.
